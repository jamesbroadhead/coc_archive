[Fear in a Bottle](https://www.yog-sothoth.com/wiki/index.php/Fear_in_a_Bottle) is a 1920s scenario set in Arkham by John A. Almack. Investigators begin by investigating the theft of a metal bottle found in an archaeological dig, and come into contact with Serpent Men, and potentially Sfatlicllp, a daughter of Tsathoggua.

### The Good

* Unusual Monster: Sfatlicllp is barely mentioned in Mythos texts. It's good and exciting to see unique and custom monsters in published scenarios. See below for the changes and additions I made to make Sfatlicllp more memorable.

* Background Material: The Serpentfolk/Hyperborean background to the story is quite well researched and detailed. This probably came from Chaosium's [Book of Eibon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1251148.The_Book_of_Eibon).

* NPCs: There is a good set of interesting NPCs for the players to encounter. Keepers should refer to [H.P. Lovecraft's Arkham](https://www.yog-sothoth.com/wiki/index.php/Arkham_Unveiled) for those that are mentioned but not detailed in the scenario.


### The Questionable

* Structure: The scenario does not allow investigators to follow their investigation fully from beginning to end. All threads lead to dead ends, and the keeper must move the action along through a phone call from an NPC, who has done much of the investigation for them off-screen. As written, the scenario is a bit rail-roady. This is the principal sin of this scenario, and keepers should think through ways to overcome this while preparing.

* Too "much":

  * Arkham: The scenario leans very heavily on [H.P. Lovecraft's Arkham](https://www.yog-sothoth.com/wiki/index.php/Arkham_Unveiled), which is only debatably to its credit. It would be easier to follow if it left details about the setting to the keeper (in my case in particular: I moved the setting to Edinburgh)
  * Languages: There are two Mythos languages represented here, as well as a Mythos text in Ancient Greek. My players found it hard to keep track of the different languages, as well as which tomes they needed to use to translate them.
  * Antagonists(?): Beyond the Serpentfolk, there are gangsters, ghouls, and Sfatlicllp herself. There isn't really enough plot to support this many groups. There are no NPC details for playing the ghouls or gangsters (and your players should probably ally themselves with one of these groups to survive the final encounter)

* Spell Missing: Call/Dismiss Sfatlicllp is not detailed.
