This is an archive of Call of Cthulhu scenarios which have dropped off the web. They were mostly recovered from the Internet Archive, starting from [E.P. Berglund's Cthulhu Mythos on the Internet](http://www.epberglund.com/RGttCM/cmnet09a.htm) page.

If you'd like to help, send me a one-line summary with more detail than the below. If you'd like to provide more detail on the scenarios, please add them to the [Yog Sothoth Wiki](https://www.yog-sothoth.com/wiki).

Please note that I have not yet read through most of these, so the titles and author information is partial and may be incorrect. If you are the copyright holder, and would like them removed, please contact me.
