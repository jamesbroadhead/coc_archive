A Noble Doll

This scenario is set in Europe in the 1890s, as the characters are forced to rush around, a race against not only Cthulhu's cultists, Y'golonac's priests, but against the enigmatic Cult of the Red Rose. This is a long scenario, and it involves a lot of magic, and a lot of work in the dreamland's. It will work with almost any group of investigators, but especially well with Englishmen, because the attitudes of some Brits can be well used to release some of the tension.

Chapter I: Baptized to Darkness


Section I
A character receives the letter below.

Lengrav Reinbach
Rienbach Dow Lawyers
23 Fitzen Roul
Targu Mures, Romania
4th April, 1890

Dear Sir,
I regret to inform you that your uncle, Clesvial Arnia, has passed away. Your uncle died in a tragic accident, falling to his death from the top of a bluff in the region. You are his last surviving relative, and to you falls his estate. I am the executor of your uncles not inconsiderable estate, and you are named as the soul successor in the will.
Unfortunately, there are also some specifications that you must meet before taking hold of your uncles property. Firstly he specifies that you must journey to Romania, with the tickets enclosed, along with some of your most trusted and closest friends. He then asks that when you arrive you spend at least one night staying in his manor, that lies outside the town. This being done, you will receive in full the value of his estate.
Also find enclosed a key which was to be sent to you the moment of his death. I do not no what it is for.
When you arrive, seek me out at our law firms and I will provide you with the keys to the house.


Yours Sincerely



Lengrav Reinbach

Enclosed also is a small bronze key, as well as tickets that will allow seven people to get to Romania, and to Targu Mures.



Section II
On the way to Romania while on the train, the characters apartments will be ransacked while they attend dinner. The only thing to be taken will be the small bronze key. The conductor cannot help them, and the police will come up with nothing. The ransackers must have jumped from the train. A search will find that the door from the back of the conductors van has been opened and not closed and is flapping in the breeze.



Section III
Upon arriving in the town, the characters can go to see the Lawyer, who will give them the following letter.

Dear Nephew,

This must seem rather of a shock to you, discovering that you have a long lost uncle living in Romania. Well, the estate will soon be yours, and you may take it and leave if you wish, after fulfilling the requirements of the will. If these are not fulfilled, I have made provisions for my estate to go to charity.
I would now ask you that you read carefully what I am about to write here, take it seriously or do not, but be warned, if you do not, a devilish hell will come to the world, and wreak havoc across the lands.
In the summer of 1866, I came to live in this manor. I originally lived in Munich, but got tired of the city life, and having just made a moderate profit, I purchased this house at a low price and settled down to retire.
At the time, there was much talk in the village of the fact that the old owner had died mysteriously, and there was a lot of talk of the supernatural, vampires and other unwholesome things. At first I ignored it, but one day I was refurnishing the previous owners study, when I came upon some form of secret passage way. I had the passage opened up, and the room now forms my study, for which you have the key.
In this secret room I found many old and ancient works, some speaking of things so blasphemous that I burnt them for the evil words. I have been a Catholic all my life, and such blasphemy should not be allowed on Earth.
My mind, however, was changed when I discovered among the magical paraphernalia a very odd doll, or dress makers mannequin. It appeared as a normal mannequin, yet it had singularly disturbing features to its face and torso. The arms and legs also appear slightly dysfunctional, and when the whole creation was assembled, it gave out a radiance of such evil that I decided to dispose of it. But, not fire, nor acids, nor steel would even impinge upon its scabrous surface.
I now regretted destroying so many of the tomes, but from what was left, I gathered that the artefact, for that is what it is, is many eons aged, and can by used for vile magical purposes. I also discovered that it's true name could not be spoken by a mortal in its presence without awakening creatures so blasphemous from the depths of hell, that I destroyed immediately all reference to the name of the thing.
I now set out to destroy the thing, for its power and evil could by used in many ways, not the least of controlling other people! Imagine the chaos it could cause! The following passage came from a book buried deep in the Royal Library in London:

'...and this thing, evil and eternal, a shape of a man, but that which could be used to destroy man, and call forth beings of unutterable foulness, can not be destroyed by man but only by those who are above man but weaker than man... ...and only with the aid of...'

The book was rent and torn as if some madman had tried to destroy it, but from further researches I discovered that the dream gods of men can destroy that which would destroy man.
My researches however had not gone unnoticed by others that sought the power that the mannequin could give. And while returning to Romania, I was accosted four times by different people attempting to gain the artefact. I have hence pawned the artefact, secretly, and only kept the head.
Please, if you can, destroy this foulness from the Earth.


Yours Sincerely



Clesvial Arnia

If all the conditions of the will have been fulfilled so far he will take them up to manor house.



Section IV
The manor house is normal, but the decor is very dark and brooding, and searching it will find nothing out of the ordinary except a long thin passageway that leads from one of the bedrooms to a wooden door. The top of the door has been smashed in, while to bottom of the door is the lock which fits the bronze key. There is the smell of ammonia in the air. Inside there was a bookshelf, is a large box, and some form of cooling apparatus, there is ammonia all over the floor, the box is half full of water. Also, there is a sort of black viscous ichor dropped all over the place. There are books scattered about and most are destroyed beyond reading. SPOT HIDDEN to see an untouched book, which gives +5% Cthulhu Mythos, and a symbol to hold down Great Old Ones for a short period of time. On one wall there is a picture, now covered in water, of a sunny scene. Behind it is a loose brick, which covers a small area that contains a mannequins eyeless head, with a small pawn brokers slip.



Section V
During the night, the characters hear a dogs howling suddenly cut off outside, and then some banging and crashing in the house. Getting up to see what is going on, at the bottom of the main stairs there is a flying polyp mauling a wolf. It will attack the characters if it sees them.



Section VI
The next day, the characters are visited by the lawyer at about 9:00am. He says "Well, I already have an offer for one certain antique", he seams excited, "I was approached by a man this morning who offered 100,000 pounds for a certain mannequins head. I have a contact address here if you would like to see the man." The characters can go and see the man, who is a tall well muscled man who is wearing a suit yet seems uncomfortable with it. He is actually a Cthulhu Cultist, but pretends to by a English Art collector, looking for one of the first examples of a dress makers doll. He will flee the town of the characters do not sell, and will say that they do not know what they are getting themselves into.



Section VII
The characters can see the pawn broker, who apologetically tells them that the body was sold on the International Modelling parts in Strazburg, Austria, after he heard that your uncle had died. The thing did not look right, and he had no end of bad luck since taking it.



Chapter II: Austria & The Servants


Section I
When the characters reach Salzburg, they can easily find the store. There are workers cleaning up, as it looks like there was a break in, all the store front has been smashed in. Finding the manager, Heinheltz Colf, he will tell the characters it was their second break in. If asked about the Mannequin, he will look it up, and they did receive it, but where the parts went is unknown as that was stolen in the break in. The parts defiantly were sold on, almost immediately, since they were in such good condition. It is normal to dismantle a mannequin like that one, one that hasn't got a head or any other part.



Section II
As the characters leave the shop and start heading back towards where they are staying, a SPOT HIDDEN roll will locate that a man is following them. He is short and flabby, also old and greying. His clothes are not very good, torn and stained all over. When accosted, the man (Y'golonac's Cultist) will attempt to mind control the characters into fighting each other, and then handing over the head. He will run away if he cannot mind control (roll POW vs POW on resistance table to resist mind control.)



Section III
It is now late at night, and the characters make LISTEN rolls to hear a lot of footsteps on the hall outside. There rooms are suddenly attacked by a lot of old flabby men, who are attempting to take the head. There are about 7 of them. If one is captured, then he will tell the characters they were sent by a man called Golon who lives in a house manor on the edge of the city. Once the bodies have lain for about one minute they change into horrible forms of Y'golonac and then vaporize as the men finally die. The police will not listen to the characters outlandish claims, without bodies. The characters are also outsiders which makes it difficult for them to get any action. If pressed a number of officers(2) will by assigned, and will discover that a man called Golon has a large number of old servants, but none have been reported missing.



Section IV
The house is a large one that is surrounded by a huge high wall, as the characters start to go over the walls, SPOT HIDDEN to locate that there are some other men in the garden, stalking through the plants, holding swords and clubs. These men have a red rose tattooed over their right eye. They attack the house, and the characters can sneak and hide to remain unnoticed. The Cult of the Red Rose will ignore them, but Y'golonac's men will attack them. Searching will allow the characters to enter the central room of the house, and in there find a book on the mannequin,(+3% Cthulhu Mythos, D4 Sanity Loss), and the documents that were taken from the shop. Suddenly a member of the Cult of the Red Rose enters. He says, copy the documents and then leave or die.

The following is out of the document:

Company	City	Country	Part
Custom Mannequin Designers	Anzio	Italy	Left Leg
The Kings Garments	Munion	Germany	Upper Torso
Modelling Parts	Tilburg	Netherlands	Right Arm
Germain Deredor	Paris	France	Right Leg
Jaques Houlm	Routen	France	Left Arm
The House of Hammond	Dover	England	Lower Torso

The only relevant passage out of the book is:

"A the mortal's gods were so puny, that not even they could destroy That-Which-Can-Bring-Back-Those-Who-Are-Trapped-And-Sleeping, without the aid of a branch of the Elm of Corote."



Chapter III: They who come from the seas


Section I
The characters can take a train from Strazburg strait to Anzio. The village is a small fishing village, populated only by people who speak Italian, so the characters may have to arrange for a translator before they leave for the village. If they do not have one, they will have great difficulty even locating the shop. The fishing village is located on the Tyrrhenian sea, and it has one small inn, 'The Wanderer', who's rooms are moderately clean and there is breakfast served every morning in the common room. When they arrive, it is late (about 8:00pm) and the shop is closed. It is located on a sea side boulevard. The owner does not live in the shop and there are no lights inside. The characters can pick the lock, (but this should be out of character), and if they do they can gain access. There are parts of models lying all over the place, and since it is dark and there is no light to speak of, it would take hours to locate the correct part. The shop appears to be a shambles.



Section II
The next morning, the characters awake at about 6:00am and can descend to the common room for breakfast. They are presented with a wide array of fish products, as well as a newspaper. The following story catches an eye:

Runways, or Kidnaps

Two local girls, Evanda Itana and Juliana Liro, who vanished last week have still not been found. Local police can find no evidence of kidnapping, except for the fact that the girls rooms were both in a shambles. This is consistent with not only a kidnapping but also a flight from Anzio. Local police speculated yesterday that one, or both of the girls had got themselves pregnant and fled together to get away from the disaster that they had created fro themselves. Evanda and Juliana did not know each other very well, Evanda's mother said, which is a point that does not support them fleeing together. At this stage, the police will continue investigations for another week, and if no new evidence appears by that time, they will give up the search.

The characters may find it difficult asking questions, as these disappearances have made the villages suspicious of outsiders.



Section III
As the characters finish breakfast, they hear a ringing clarion outside, on a carriage that rushes past. Rushing outside, they can see a wisp of smoke coming from the sea side boulevard area. There are people hurrying towards it, and some are shouting 'The Mannequin place is on fire'.



Section IV
As the characters approach the shop, they can see there is a fire carriage with a large barrel of water on the back being used to put out the fire, also the villages have made a line with buckets to the ocean and are spooning water onto the shop. The blaze appears to have a good hold however, and most of the attention is directed to preventing it from spreading. There is a man in a suit standing dejectedly to one side watching the shop burn. The characters can talk to him, and his name is Luichi Maripano, the owner. 'Lost it all, eh? What sort of luck is that, and I just had a big order. Never fulfil it now.' If they ask him about receiving a leg from International Modelling Parts, he says that he did, and that unfortunately it is no more. Suddenly from inside, the characters hear a cry, and a man, covered in soot and coughing stumbles out, he carries a baby wrapped in blankets. The man is has a bare chest, and a SPOT HIDDEN roll will locate that he has some form of design on his chest, almost all coveered by soot and ash. He stumbles over to the firemen who grab him, and put him on a cart which drives off. The characters will be told he is suffering from smoke inhalation. The shop collapses just as he is driven away. Searching the wreckage of the shop will not locate the mannequin leg.



Section V
The characters can make enquires at the fire station about the fireman, but no one there knows who he was. They assumed that he was from another town. He also was not suffering as badly from smoke inhalation as they thought, and he was able to leave almost immediately. One of the men remembers him very carefully handing the child over so as to keep the blanket, which seemed to bulge slightly. Perhaps he stole something while in the shop. No one has seen him before. The child was the daughter of a Mrs Perfistis. The characters can go and see Mrs (Lara) Perfistis, but she will say that she only discovered her baby missing when she returned from helping put the fire out. She was in a panic and immediately reported her missing, and then had the fire service bring the child around to her relief, some little time later. She has no idea how her daughter got to the scene of the fire, or what she was doing there.



Section VI
Apart from the inn there is one other tavern in the village, where the characters can enquires about the fireman. In the bar which is by the sea shore, there is an old man sitting in the corner, who recalls that a rather sooty man dressed in rags came in about twenty minutes after the fire and ordered a drink, drank it and then left, heading up the sea shore away from the town. Going that way, the characters will find a hut hidden in the sand dunes with a SPOT HIDDEN roll. It is a single room hut, and inside there is a half eaten meal of fish. SPOT HIDDEN or TRACKING to locate some cart tracks in the sand. These lead through the sand dunes, until eventually the characters come upon a gipsy caravan parked about ten meters above the high tide mark. The characters can see nothing except the caravan.



Section VII
There are strange sounds coming from behind the caravan, and when the characters move behind it, with SNEAK or HIDE rolls to avoid being seen, they see two men and two Deep Ones taking turns raping two women. 1/D6 SANITY LOSS.



Description I
'I think their predominant colour was a grayish-green, though they had white bellies. They were mostly shiny and slippery, but the ridges of their backs were scaly. Their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid, while their heads were the heads of fish, with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed. At the dies of their necks were palpitating gills, and their long paws were webbed. They hopped irregularly, sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four. ... Their croaking, baying voices ... held all the dark shades of expression which their staring faces lacked. ... They were the blasphemous fish-frogs of the nameless design - living and horrible.' -The Shadow Over Innsmount by H.P. Lovecraft

The men all have a huge green eye tattooed on their chests. The characters can attack the men and the Deep Ones. When the men die, the tattoo on their chests vanish. The two women are both wide eyed and staring, almost scared out of their wits. They hold each other and gibber to themselves. Inside the caravan there are two bunks, as well as a chest full of food. There is also a shrine sitting at the end of the caravan. On it lies the leg, as well as a book, called The Book of True Worship. This gives +6% CTHULHU MYTHOS, D6 SANITY LOSS. Inside there is a huge passage on horrible rites involving worship of some form of great creature, Cthulhu, who lies dreaming under the ocean, and how when it awakes, all it's worshipers will cavort madly across the world in a time of pleasure. Also there is mention of the living servitors of this Cthulhu, called Deep Ones, who spread the holy message. There is also a passage on summoning another creature, Yog-Sothoth, a mighty Magus God, through months of feeding,and then finally letting it free to rend the countryside.



Chapter IV: Too late



Section I
The characters trip to Munion on the train is uneventful. As they come in, they see a huge forest, and a castle with lights on (it is night). The characters can go to the town hall to locate the shop called The Kings Garments. Remember that everyone speaks German here, and it will be difficult to talk to people unless the characters hire a translator, which can be done at the town hall. The shop is in an up market district of the town. The characters can ask to see the manager, and will be ushered in efficiently. The manager will apologetically say that he just sold the upper torso to a man, who had paid 50 pounds for it. The man was old, and wore a very thick jacket as well as a lot of clothing. The characters get a complete description.



Section II
Enquires at local hotels and inns(Northman, Nias's Hotel, Warark, Soldiers Rest, Narand's Inn). At the fourth hotel the characters strike it lucky, and discover that the man is staying there.



Section III
As the characters are standing in the lobby, they notice(or have pointed out to them) the man walking into the foyer. Accosting the man, he will deny ever having bought the strange artefact, and will even invite the characters up to his room to have a look. As the enter the corridor outside, they hear some noise if a LISTEN roll is made. As they enter the room they disturb three men who are climbing out of the window. One of them carries the torso, and they flee to the street as soon as the characters appear. The men are tall and well built.



Section IV
The characters can pursue them through the town, but they vanish into the forest on the outskirts. A successful TRACKING roll will locate a way, but the characters are accosted by two policemen who ask them what they think they are doing. The police officers will warn against the characters going through the forest because there are some bandits in the forest, and they are calling in the army in a couple of weeks to deal with it. Also the castle is uninhabited, and so there is no reason to see the lights on, because the castle has been abandoned for years and there is no one there. Perhaps the bandits have made it their home base.



Section V
The characters can sneak out to the castle, but may encounter a number of bandits in the forest. The front is all fully fortified, and they can see men walking across the fort tops. Moving around the back, the characters can see that part of the back of the castle is badly damaged, and moving through it, the characters can begin to sneak into the castle. There are Cthulhu Cultists all over the place. Suddenly there is a cry and explosion from the front, and gout's of flame all over the palace. The Cult of the Red Rose are attacking all about. Through the chaos, the characters some onto a room, where there are thirteen men standing inside a huge symbol carved into the ground, in the centre is a huge Star-Spawn of Cthulhu presently being bound. If the binding is unfinished the creature will go mad killing everything, else it will only attack The Cult of the Red Rose. If the characters can cause the summoners to be killed, they can obtain the document that was lying on one side of the room. It containsinformation on it that allows magick to be cased using the mannequin as a focus. Every time this is done, a character gains 5 MP for the spell being cast, and loses 1 sanity point.



Description I
'... a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind. This thing ... was of a somewhat bloated corpulence ... It lumbered slavering into sight and groping squeezed its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway. ... a mountain walked or stumbled.' -The Call of Cthulhu by H.P. Lovecraft

Searching, and occasional encounters with combatants of either side will locate a locked room, door STR 12, or they can destroy the lock. Inside is the torso.



Chapter V: Thief in the Night


Section I
While travelling to the Netherlands, the characters will encounter on the train in passing an old fat flabby man (Y'golonac's worshipper). Later, they will discover that there are three of these men, and just before the characters reach Tilburg, in the Netherlands, the men will try to ransack their apartments and steal any parts that they can. They will then pull the emergency break on the train, knock the conductor out and flee.



Section II
On arriving in Tilburg, the characters can go to the town hall to get an address, upon visiting the address, they will discover that Modelling Parts has been closed down. The part is not inside, and the entire building has been cleared out. Research in the town hall will locate that the lawyer who was the executor of the will is called Ivor Malanak, working for Malanak and Malanak. Visiting the lawyers office, the characters can discover that the owners brother obtained the estate, a Erin Ferol, and the items from the shop were put in secure storage at the bank, until it was released by the next heir. They are given an address.



Section III
On arriving at Erin's house, the characters can knock on the door, but receive no answer. If they immediately go around the back of the house, then they will find that the back door has been battered down, and there is an odd keening noise emanating throughout the lower levels of the house. Moving upstairs, the characters will see a star vampire feeding on a corpse in the corridor. It will finish feeding in thirty seconds, and remain visible for three minutes thereafter.



Description I
'Slowly but surely the dim outlines of a Presence came into view; the blood-filled outlines of that unseen shambler from the stars. It was red and dripping; an immensity of pulsing, moving jelly; a scarlet blob with myriad tentacular trunks that waved and waved. There were suckers on the tips of the appendages, and these were opening and closing with ghoulish list. ... The ting was bloated and obscene; a headless, faceless, eyeless bulk with the ravenous maw and titanic talons of a star born monster. The human blood on which it had fed revealed the hitherto invisible outlines of the feaster.' - The Shambler from the Stars by Robert Bloch

If the characters did not go in immediately, they find Erin's body totally drained of blood. The arm is not in the house.



Section IV
The characters can report or wait for the body to be discovered. Two days after that, the lawyers Malanak and Malanak give notice that Erin had no will so all his possessions go to his cousin, Shoringarner Ferol. The characters can go to his manor house, which is located on the outside of the town. There are a lot of workers working over the grounds around the manor, but many of them carry not only farming tools but swords and axes. The characters will be shown to the manor house, and will meet Shoringarner. He is a short man, with broad shoulders, and a black pointed beard. He does not seem shocked at anything the characters tell him, only rather amused. He will tell them that even if he had the arm, he would not give it to them, as it is obviously valuable. He says that he does not even know if he has the arm or not, as he has not gone to the bank. As they leave, a LISTEN roll will hear a strange gurgling sound coming from an outhouse, and the characters can see four cows being lead into the shed. There is a strange ramp that leads into the shed. The workers will not allow the characters to approach.



Section V
When the characters return from the house, they discover that their room was pick locked, ransacked, and any parts not hidden with a HIDE roll stolen. The characters can ask in the hotel lobby, and some people remember seeing two fat old men going up to their rooms.



Section VI
The characters are awoken with a successful LISTEN roll that night, and hear the same sound that they heard in Erin's. They are attacked by a Star Vampire, and following is the Cousin, who will try to take any parts in the room. If he cannot, he will flee.



Section VII
The characters can ask around about the old flabby men, and will discover that they were here but left town on the late train to France. Also, enquiring about the cousin will show that he had a huge herd of sheep, and now he has none.



Section VIII
If the cousin is still alive, then town is suddenly enveloped by a huge storm cloud, with thunder and lightning. The characters will have to rush to the manor and kill him to prevent the summoning of Yog-Sothoth. All the workers have fled, and he his preparing to open the gates on the outhouse. The characters can search the house to discover a document called Wizards Spells (+5% Cthulhu Mythos, D8 Sanity Loss) and on reading it they gain the spells summon Star Vampire, Bind Star Vampire, Summon Yog-Sothoth, Contact Yog-Sothoth. There is also a document called 'Ancient Human Forms', and reading it they can discover information on the mannequin, and the following spell Track Evil that can only be cast with the mannequin.



Spells
Summon Star Vampire: 10MP, 1D3 SANITY; The spell must be cast where the stars can be seen, or could be seen at night. A bowl of human blood must be tipped over the caster, who must be naked, and a chant said.
Bind Star Vampire: 3MP; A living creature, mouse size or larger, must be given to the Star Vampire, and a chant said.
Summon Yog-Sothoth: 12MP, 1D8 SANITY; Takes months of constant feeding of the half formed beast. Each day, the caster does not regain any magic points, and Yog-Sothoth must be feed for at least fifty days before being released.
Contact Yog-Sothoth: 4MP, 1D3 SANITY; Must be done in an open place, a chant must be said.
Track Evil: 4MP, 1 SANITY; A chant must be said over a part of the Mannequin. It will pull in the direction of the closest evil. Since the mannequin itself is evil, it will direct towards its other parts.


Chapter VI: Paris, Half Saved


Section I
The characters get on the train to Paris, and it travels off without mishap. During the first night into France there is a grinding crashing sound from the rear of the train, and the rear carriage is derailed. All the lights in the train go out, and four of the Cthulhu cultists will raid and attempt to steal all the parts of the mannequin that they can find. They will then flee off the end of the train. The train will take all of the next day to get the conductors carriage back on.



Section II
Germain Deredor is an up market designer. They can make enquires about the shop's location at the City Centre, or by checking through an address book at the train station. When they arrive they are ushered through to see Germain. He is a tall blond haired, blue eyed Frenchman. He is very apologetic, but he has already sold the body part to a man who had an odd red rose painted onto his head over the left eye. He did not give a name or address, but paid in franks.



Section III
The characters can buy a newspaper, or check into a hotel and have a newspaper delivered free of charge. In the paper, they can read the following article.

Man Found Dead

A man was found floating in the Seine late last night by a gendarme walking the rounds by the river. The man was not a Frenchman, but gendarme's have been able to track down where he was staying, in a local hotel. His room was ransacked, and it is believed that he was killed there in a bungled burglary, although there was still money in the room. The gendarme have not released any information on the cause of death, but they have said that there was some paint or other substance over the mans forehead.

The characters can also go to see the gendarme, and with a little persuasion/fast talking they can see his body. The gendarme will not explain what happened, only show the characters. The body has been almost completely mutilated, with bits of skin shaved off, ears ripped, eyes cut out, a total torture(1D2 SANITY). There was also a man fleeing into the northern part of the city.



Section IV
Any parts that the characters have left can be used to track the other part of the mannequin or they can go wandering around in the northern quarter of the city, and eventually with three successive luck rolls spot a well built man who matches the description given to them. There are a lot of poor people about, and the characters may be mugged (1 on a D6 each hour in the area). If they are mugged, it is by 1D6 scabrous men.



Section V
If the characters used the mannequin it will lead them to a house with high walls, but if they spot a man he will do the same thing. If accosted he will fight and then flee to the house, but even under torture will not give up. He is totally mad and devoted to Cthulhu. As the characters approach the house, they see five beggars, all old large flabby men, rise up and smash into the door, and run howling in. More random beggars follow. The characters can charge in and search for the leg, but if they use the mannequin it will guide them only to Y'golonac's worshippers, or weakly to Cthulhu's worshippers. Eventually, they can find a leg, but the mannequin does not guide them to it. If they take it, they will be attacked on the way out, and it will be broken in the scuffle.



Section VI
The characters can return to Germain Deredor's boutique, and question his employees, and one called Howern Freen, who stole it for another man, Hern, and replaced it with a fake. The characters are given an address of Hern. they can arrive at Hern, they smell smoke and ash, and can see that one size of the house had been totally burned. Hern is a tall dark haired man, with matted hair, and an unshaven black beard. Hern will eagerly give the characters the leg, and tell them the following:

'I took it when I discovered that some men of Y'golonac, who is a sort of demonic priest god, who recruits only the most evil of people, where trying to obtain it. I was interested to learn that the Cult of the Red Rose also wanted to obtain it, but they are a bit of an enigma...'



Chapter VII: Marshes



Section I
The train trip to Routen is uneventful, but the trains to and from Routen run very irregularly, only once every fortnight. The characters can ask the conductor about this and he will tall them that Routen was once a most prosperous fishing village, but has recently fallen on hard times and there is not much commerce into or out of the village. For the last five miles of the train journey, the tracks run through marshlands, with concrete and steel holding the train tracks in place.



Section II
The characters arrive in Routen. It is a small town of about five hundred people, although there are many abandoned houses, about another five hundred. There is a single inn, the Singing Sailor, and everyone speaks French. The accent is slightly strange, and off beat, and a French roll can be made to determine that it is an older dialect, often spoken in isolated towns and villages. As the characters travel through the town, they can go to the town square, on which one side is the registry office, and on the other a large church, with a small gold plaque on one of it's walls reading 'Order of the Lords of the Marsh'. Whenever asked about this the locals will clam up. The characters can enquires about the location of Jaques Houlm's boutique, but the records office is no help and almost no one will talk about it. With persuasion or intimidate etc the characters can discover that it burnt down a little over a week ago, and can also obtain a location. The shop itself is on the waterfront, and is totally destroyed by fire. The shops around it are damaged as well. The characters can try to use another part to track the arm, but it will just lead them around in circles.



Section III
The characters go to bed, and during the night make LISTEN rolls. If they do then they awaken and can hear in the distance an odd sort of rising and falling wailing sound. Looking out the window, which overlooks the marshes, they see lights bobbing about all over the place, as well as silhouettes of humans. Abruptly the chant reaches a crescendo and all the lights go out.



Section IV
The characters can go out into the marsh in the day, and after a track roll can locate a clean stone alter. All around there is glass on the ground (DEXx5 to avoid glass slicing shoes or skin etc). Some of the glass is coloured. As the characters are standing there, they can make a listen roll. If they do they will tramping footsteps coming towards them. Hiding with a Hide roll, the characters can avoid notice. Out of the marshes come a group of thirty men, all wearing red and green ceremonial robes. They move to the alter and begin to wail and screen. INTx5 to remember what they say, and learn the spell Unlock Alter(5MP opens this alter). The alter stone rotates upwards, and the men descend into the blackness below. If the characters confront any of them, they will be ushered away, with words to the effect that it is their sacred ritual and outsiders are not allowed to observe it.



Section V
The characters can make further enquires about Jaques Houlm, and with successful persuade or intimidate rolls can discover that she vanished when her store burnt down, as well as the fact that she was not a member of the church, and was unholy. Alternately, the characters are approached by a man who will give them this information for a fee(100 pounds). If this happens, he will be found dead outside the hotel the next day, strangled to death.



Section VI
The characters can enquire at the church after her, and they will claim to know nothing, although the characters will discover that everyone in the town are members of the church.



Section VII
The characters are attacked by two Shantaks(0/D6 SANITY)



Description I
'They were not any birds or bats known elsewhere on earth ... for they were larger than elephants and had heads like a horse's ... The Shantak-bird has scales instead of feathers and those scales are very slippery.' -The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath, by H.P. Lovecraft

The characters can flee long enough to summon a star vampire and set it against the Shantaks. If they do, the Star Vampire will win.



Section VIII
After beating off the Shantaks, the characters will observe a ritual going on in the marshes. They can rush out there, and will observe twenty five men, the ones in the odd red and green robes, lying on the ground moaning, and five others with a naked woman lying over the hole where the alter is normally. The man raises a knife and is about to kill the woman. The characters can save her, and only have to deal with the five men standing up. When they start this, she is thrown into the alter hole, and it begins to close. The characters can either dive in and pull her out, with DEXx5 rolls, or open the alter afterwards. All that is under it is a room covered with much and ichor, like the Shantaks. She is Jaques Houlm and will show the characters where she hid the leg, when she discovered that the church was after it. It is in one of the abandoned houses. The characters will have to hole up there for a while until the next train comes. There are constant searches for the characters.



Chapter VIII: Dream Lands


Section I
The characters must go to Calais to get on a ship to go to Dover. The train journey is uneventful, unless they have all the parts. If they do, then they are attack repeatedly by Y'golonac's worshippers who will eventually steal one or more parts. When they are on the ship, they see a flabby old man (Y'golonac's Worshipper), who will flee when he sees the characters. He can loose the characters in a storage area of the ship. Enquires with the steward on the ship will show that he does remember such a man, who has a cabin on deck E, cabin 12. The characters can go down to deck E, it is the lowest of decks, and go to room 12. The door is locked, and the characters can batter down the door. Inside, the man is lying on his bead. Next to him on a bedside table is a bottle (500ml) of an off-white milky liquid. There is some of that liquid on his mouth, and on a glass that has fallen to the floor and broken. he also holds a body part (one that has been taken from the characters already) that is flickeringand fading. If the characters make a grab for it, it vanishes. Killing the body of the worshipper will achieve nothing.



Section II
The characters can drink some of the liquid. Anything they are touching when they fall asleep will go with them into the Dream Lands. The characters find themselves at the top of a staircase, there are seventy steps, until the staircase ends in the Cavern of Flame, a large room with burning brands all around the walls. There are two men, with long beards, Nasht and Kaman-Thah, who greet the characters. They seem surprised, but readily let the characters pass, through into the seven hundred steps staircase. At some stage, the stairs cease going down, and start going up, but the change over is almost unnoticeable until you pass it. Idea roll to detect this change over. Each player now gains the skills Dreaming at their POW level, and Dream Lore at half their Cthulhu Mythos.



Section III
The characters encounter an end to the stairs, and a trap door. This leads up into a lovely forest full of trees and birds chirping and singing. A dream lore roll, or a luck roll, will allow the characters to locate Ulthar, there are cats everywhere. There is an inn in Ulthar, and the characters can ask about the flabby man, and will be told that a man like that did pass through, and headed up towards Norith, which is by the sea. On the way, the characters encounter Bokrug.



Description I
'A greenish-blue iguana like creature confronted them, its metallic scales glittering in the dancing light.'

Bokrug will try to convince them to give him any parts that they have, if they have none, they will not encounter it. The elder sign from the first adventure can be used to contain Bokrug, or can flee and try to beat Bokrug off. It will give up eventually.



Section IV
The characters arrive in Norith, which is a teaming town that has many inns and taverns. There are a multitude of different people in the town, and there is many ships docked in the docks. If the characters have any body parts, they will be accosted by men serving moon beasts, who will offer to purchase the parts for gems and gold, and then take the characters back to be attacked by Moon Beasts, or they will be attacked at random for the parts. Seeing the moon beast causes 0/1D8 Sanity Loss



Description II
'They were ... great grayish-white slippery things which could expand and contract at will, and whose principle shape - though it often changed - was that of a sort of toad without any eyes, but with a curious vibrating mass of short pink tentacles on the end of its blunt, vague snout.' - The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath by H.P. Lovecraft



Section V
The characters can ask questions about a flabby man, and once per day make a luck roll. If this roll is successful, then they find someone who remembers a carriage man who gave passage to such a man to Kariath, which is located far to the North and West. The characters must travel to the West to the port town of Janitculn and then travel by boat to Kariath. The characters can find a carriage bound for Janitculn.



Section VI
In Janitculn, the characters will have to stay in an inn for another five days before a boat can take them to Kariath. Three of the other people staying in the inn have an odd aperture to their faces which makes them look slightly ingrown, or mutant. Enquires will show that these men come far from the west, where few people leave once they have gone their.



Section VII
The characters are woken up in the morning by an odd precession moving past on the street, all dancing and calling. From the nearby buildings, there are people throwing leaves down. The characters can enquire, and they are told that they are the men of Corote, those who guard the Elm of Corote, and give parts of it to those who are deemed worthy, the elm is situated in the centre of the town. The next day the characters can go to the elm, and beg for a part of the tree. If they tell their story truthfully, (but may omit some parts), then they will be granted a part of the elm, a small branch, which can be taken outside the dreamland's. This is a special property of the tree, as it was created by the Human gods of the Dream Lands, and no one knows where they dwell.



Section VIII
The characters can travel to the city of Kariath without any interruption. When they arrive, enquires can be made in the many inns in the city. The flabby man bought his own ship and left not half a day ago, fleeing to the demon city of Shadrikar. The characters will not be able to hire any ship, and the king of the city will provide no help, although being apologetic. The characters also will have nothing that is worth the purchase of a boat. Just as the characters are about to give up, they are approached by a man with a red rose tattooed on his forehead. He explains that he as a member of the Red Rose has a vested interest in seeing the mannequin destroyed, and will offer the use of a ship that he has. He cannot go after the man alone, because he is bound to this city, never able to leave, but the characters can have the use of his boat.



Section IX
The characters can take a boat, all crewed by the strange westerner people. They seen highly intelligent, but perhaps a little uncoordinated, gangly. On the third day of travelling, the characters encounter a small boat, with the flabby man on it. Upon being bordered, he will change into the form of Y'golonac, and attack the characters and especially the crewmen of the characters boat. 1/1D20 Sanity Loss



Description III
'...a bloated, glowing figure, with no head, but two ungainly mouths resting in the palms of its blasphemous hands.'

The elder sign can be used to restrict Y'golonac, and the crewmen will fight as well. Once the characters have killed Y'golonac they can search the ship and locate the body part.



Section X
Returning to Ulthar to leave via the enchanted forest will be fairly easy, except the Bokrug will attack the characters again, and attempt to gain the arm. If it did not attack them at the beginning, it now does and tries to convince them to give it the arm.



Chapter IX: Untrustworthy Allies


Section I
After leaving the dream lands through the enchanted wood, the characters have a normal sleep for about three hours. At this stage, if most of the parts have not been stolen, they have to be by both the Cthulhu Cultists and Y'golonac's Worshippers. The characters awaken, and are all on separate beds arrayed out in a large room, there is sunlight streaming in through windows with bars on them. All their equipment is placed in drawers at the end of their beds, but all the body parts have been removed. The elm branch is lying on the chest of the character who took it out of the dream lands. The door is locked, and there are steel bars on the door.



Section II
There is a knock on the door and when the characters respond, it is unlocked and a man walks in. He has a red rose tattooed on his forehead. He introduces himself, 'I am Thomas Hawk, a member of the Red Rose.' When asked about the body parts they will be told that 'unfortunately the one recovered from the dream lands was stolen before the red rose could reach the characters.' He will be evasive when asked about what the red rose do or their aims. He will say that they are hunting the parts of the mannequin to destroy it. If the characters wish, then a temporary alliance can be formed until this goal is complete. Even if they do not wish, he will imply that there will by terminal consequences if the deal is not done. When the characters do agree to the deal, he will tell them of the two main groups looking for the artefact and why. These are Cthulhu's Cultists, trying to raise Cthulhu and spread their influence over the world, and Y'golonac who through his worshippers is trying to gain it to destroy the wall behind which he is imprisoned. Other groups or wizards may also be seeking it for it's innate magical power.



Section III
The characters are invited to stay until word comes of cultists. The characters will be told that a lot of the red rose have been killed in the attempts to get the mannequin, and their numbers are stretched just to hunting for the men. The characters get reports that Y'golonac's men are in Dover, and have been seen recently. They have some of the parts. The characters can use the part that they do have to locate the place that the worshippers are staying. It is a high walled town house with wide gardens. They can prepare a raid with the Cult of the Red Rose, and execute the raid without difficulty. They will meet no resistance that cannot be overcome by the four cult members given to them for the raid. Inside they can easily recover the parts that have been stolen by Y'golonac's worshippers, at least one.



Section IV
At some stage, probably now, the characters will want to investigate the House of Hammond. Enquiries in the company registry office or town hall can allow the characters to locate the address of the House of Hammond. It is on the main street of town. When they arrive, the address is being painted, and equipment moved in for a bakery. The characters can make enquiries inside, and will discover from the new manager that the House of Hammond closed down in Dover, and Hammond has left for his ancestral home in Scotland. A forwarding address was left, and it is a country house in Scotland, an out of the way place.



Section V
The cult of the Red Rose informs the characters that five men believed to be Cthulhu's cultists were seen leaving Dover toward the North three days ago. The characters can begin to track them using the mannequin, and will be given a carriage and/or horses. The characters can begin tracking, and as they enter Scotland, they pass through a village. As they pass through, and come out the other side, the mannequin reverses its direction. The characters can stay in the village, but the mannequin will give no clear reading at all, but will always point back towards the village.



Section VI
There is an inn in the village, and the characters can stay there and stable their horses. It is late and they go to bed. Next morning they are awoken with breakfast and a local newspaper. The following story catches an eye:

Young Boy Vanishes

The third young boy has vanished from the Endburg Wood, behind our village. Maureen Devonport's son, Maiz, and the son of Howard Willmore, Marcus, vanished in the wood two weeks ago. Yesterday, Michael Johanu was reported missing by his mother. The police do not know what is happening, but speculate that their may be some wild animal that is taking the children, or that they are becoming lost. This is however unlikely, as the sweep through the woods after the first disappearance discovered nothing. All the boys who have vanished told their parents that they were playing near Tom's Rock, but it is uncertain if they even reached their destination.



Section VII
The characters can go out to the wood, which is behind the village. It seams a normal wood, but their is a rocky mountain in the centre of it, that can be seen from the village. The characters can investigate this rock, and with a spot hidden role, and discover a small sliver or crack. Heading down this crack, they come into a natural passage way that leads deep into the ground. It is dark, so the characters will need lights. The passage goes for about fifty meters. At the end of the passage, they come to an iron grill that has been dropped down. There is a padlock on the bottom of the grate. On the inside, the characters can see the missing boy huddled in the corner, there is a small amount of straw in the building.



Section VIII
The characters can wait, and they will hear a man coming down the passage. They may either follow him out back to his house, or accost him and force him to take them back. He has a house in the town, which is quite normal, but in the cellar there is a complete torture chamber, complete with hot irons and various other torture implements. There is the bodies of two boys, both gagged lying dead. They have been tortured to death. The characters can hand the man into custody and continue on with their journey.



Section IX
The mannequin can now be used to track the Cthulhu Cultists again. The characters take off on their horses/carriage. With a SPOT HIDDEN roll, the characters can detect a carriage following them well back on the road. They can accost the carriage, but it appears to be a lady and her maid, as well as the driver. There are also a large number of cases of baggage.



Section X
The characters catch up to the Cthulhu Cultists on the road. They are lax, and have not set any sentry to watch their camp. There are five of them can a carriage. They characters can attack, and will easily overpower the men with a surprise attack with firearms. The parts of the mannequin are located in the carriage, and recovered. Listen roll to hear the carriage that was following them approaching fast. As it does, they can see that there are six men on it, all with hand guns, muskets and rifles. Also riding up are four horsemen with rifles and sabres. They are members of the Cult of the Red Rose, and they demand the mannequin. If the characters do not hand it over, they will attack and steal it. Irrespective, they take the horses and ride towards the Hammond property.



Chapter X: Recovered


Section I
The characters are left stranded on the road, the closest village half a days walk back the way they came. They have no food, and no water. They are in a region of limited agriculture, all rocky gullies and mountainous terrain. They can either return to the village and purchase/steal horses and food and then continue on, or alternately they can continue on using tracking, sneaking and spot hidden rolls to hunt for food, scavenge for berries and locate water.



Section II
The Hammond estate is large, and as the characters approach the main house, they can smell something in the air, like an acrid rancid tinge. There is thunder in the heavens, and it begins to rain, slowly at first but harder as they reach the house. The smell gets worse the closer they get to the house, and the rain thunders down, with lightning lighting the skies. The pallor of the day is dark, almost as day turns to night. The front door is locked, and it is made of solid oak STR 23 on the resistance table. The back door has been smashed out from the inside. Inside the house the scene is of death and carnage(SANITY D8/1), there are people dressed as servants scattered about, torn limb from limb as if by a wild animal. All the furniture has been destroyed, chewed up or hurled around. There is a grand piano sundered in two, with the parts hurled around the room. SPOT HIDDEN will locate shotgun blasts in the walls all around the house, and another SPOT HIDDEN while in the kitchen will let the characters see an arm with a shotgun in hand protruding from under the oak workbench, which has been overturned. The carnage is about two days old, and flies have begun moving in. It may be necessary to remove the parts outside to prevent disease.



Section III
It is very dark outside, and the thunderstorm carries on unabated. The characters must either stay in the house overnight, or die of pneumonia and cold. All the carriages have been smashed apart, and the horses slain, ripped bodily apart. With a MEDICINE roll the characters can determine that all the arms and legs were ripped apart, not cut or sliced. Asleep that night, a LISTEN roll will awaken the characters to sounds downstairs of someone creeping about. Going down silently, they will find a man scavenging about in the kitchen for food, he is dirty and wearing the clothes of a butler, although ripped and torn. When confronted, he will first try to flee. His eyes are wild as he stares at the characters and a gibbers a little. PSYCHOLOGY or a stiff drink will calm him down. When calmed he will tell the characters that he is Thomas MacKay, former butler to Mr Hammond.

"Sirs, a most ghastly train of events lead to this pass. One month passed, our good master returned from surveying his shops in Dover and London with an mannequin part of such monstrous shape that even now it makes me feel ill to think of it. The thing was of ill omen, as when it was received in Dover, the shop's custom began to vanish and it ceased turning a profit. Mr Hammond arrived and was so affected by the artefact that he resolved to destroy the gruesome thing. Unfortunately, the shop was in such a bad way that it had to be sold to cover it's debts. When Mr Hammond arrived here he set about destroying the device. It would not burn, nor be affected by acids, nor could be damage it with gunpowder or shells. Eventually, he cast it into the lake, hoping that it would forever rest there, never to see the light of day again. Unfortunately one of the servants inexplicably dove down and obtained it and... and... wore it. He placed it onto his abdomen and suddenly was transformed into a devilish creature, who slew and wrought havoc not two days ago. I sought out my master immediately, and implored him to hide with me in the coal cellar, and obtaining his shotgun, we fled, but Mr Hammond was killed as he held off the beast for my escape. I hid the coal cellar for two days and have only now dared to come out."

Later that night, the characters are woken by bestial howls in the forest surrounding the estate.



Section IV
The next morning, the rainstorm has ended, and the characters can venture outside. The butler is asleep wherever they left him. The ground is turned to mud, and the characters can head out into the forest where they heard the howls. With a TRACKING roll they can locate two types of footprints, one of a barefooted human, and one of what looks like a wooden mannequin foot. With a LUCK roll, the characters come to a clearing where there is the carriage, almost untouched, but seven members of the Cult of the Red Rose lying on the ground torn limb from limb. There are no mannequin parts anywhere. Searching the carriage that characters come across a book, 'Dreaming et cetera'. It is written in Latin, but there is an English translation written under each Latin line. (D8 SANITY, +5% CTHULHU MYTHOS, +3% DREAMING, +5% DREAM LORE). The following passages are relevant:

'Re-entering the dreamland's after being there once is simple, as by sleeping with the sole intent of entering thereof is enough to find oneself in the enchanted forest.'

'Few objects can be carried between the dream worlds, and the true worlds, but parts of the Elm of Corote can be, as can some magical artefacts that exists in both dimensions and affect both. Destroyed in one, those artefacts are destroyed in the other. Such an artefact exists wholly in one, and partially in the other, such that no one can observe or even interact with the artefact that exists partially in one. It a person is in the same plane as the artefact, then a spell can be said to move it to the other, but beware, this spell is a difficult on the caster. The artefact when banished will end up somewhere in the enchanted wood.'

'Images of the gods of men can be seen on the face of mount Ngranek.'

There is also a spell for removing artefacts from one to the other called Phase Artefact.



Section V
That night, the characters hear screams and howls from the forest and then a banging on the front door, which caves in. (D3/0 SANITY) The madman dressed misshapenly in the mannequin parts enters, its eyes enraged and glowing. Bullets, and swords do nothing, but it will be slowed by fire and furniture. It's chance to hit is 35%, with 2D10 damage. With the chant said, the artefact will vanish, and a husk will fall where it stood. The body that was inside it collapses, and immediately falls apart into dust.



Section VI
The butler will offer to guard the characters bodies while the journey to the dreamland's to recover the body part. The characters travel down the stairs, and through into the forest without any problems. The enchanted wood is very quiet, far quieter than the first time they ventured there. The characters can spread out and search the woods, and with a LUCK and LISTEN roll one of them will hear a sound from deep within the forest, a mournful keening. Heading towards the sound, the characters come to a clearing, in which sit three dozen cats lying around and keening. In the center lies the artefact glaring maliciously at all of them. The cats watch with baleful eyes as the characters take the artefact and leave. As the artefact leaves, so do the cats. As they walk away, a SPOT HIDDEN roll will locate the body of a Moon Beast clawed to death by hundreds of tiny paws.



Spells
Phase Artefact: 15MP, 1 SANITY; The spell can only be cast on an artefact that exists in both the dream lands and on the real world, such as the mannequin. The caster must be in the presence of the artefact, when the chant is said, and it immediately vanishes to the other realm appearing somewhere in the enchanted wood. The chant takes only 2 combat rounds to say.


Chapter XI: Victory


Section I
If the characters brought the branch of the Elm with them into the dreamland's they can start immediately, otherwise they will have to leave to get it. If they do then there is a welcoming party of 2 moon beasts. Remember, dreaming rolls can be used to change things around the characters. The elm and the mannequin cannot be changed, and neither can another person or being. The characters journey to Ulthar, and can ask in the inn about mount Ngranek. There is an old man who will talk to the characters, "Arr, I was once there, to get a look at the faces of the Gods, but well, I was turned back by the nightgaunts, wot don't like outsiders in their domain. The mount itself is located on an island 'bout 50 miles from Norith. It may take you no little time to find a boat, for it took me a veritable age to find a captain who was willing to journey that way. I can give you his name, arr, Captain Halaror, of the Sleek, who's home berth is Norith itself. A deserved name for the ship too.' He knows little else, except that the faces of the gods are carven onto the side that is difficult to approach by sea for some miles. It is probably required to land and climb around to have a look.



Section II
On the way to Norith the characters are jumped by two moon beasts. Norith is a town alive, as there is some sort of fair, a travelling circus and farmers fair have set up outside of town on in a common field. In the town itself, the characters can enquires about a Captain Halaror, and at a tavern called the Merry Drunkard, the tavern keeper will remember him, 'Ay, a jovial man is our captain, comes in here every night regular as clockwork whilst in port. He's here now I believe, probably be in a bit later.' The characters can enquiries after other captains, but upon hearing the destination they will refuse to go. The characters can wait for the captain, but he never turns up. The ship Sleek, which is a fast cutter, is in the harbour, and enquiries on board will show that the captain has not been seen all day, and there is no cargo to be loaded. He went to the fair, and was supposed to be back at midday. If the characters just wait, he does not turn up.



Section III
It is night, and the fair is still going strong. There are fireworks, and animals baying and calling through the night. The characters can ask stall owners, giving a description of the Captain, and with a successful LUCK roll they will be told that he was seen at about 6:00pm drinking in the ale tent with another dark skinned man. As the characters leave, and head through the crowd, unless they make a LISTEN roll with -25%(surrounding noise) one of them will be grabbed from behind, and a knife stuck to his throat. "One word and your a dead man.", and then dragged away without the others hearing(unless a cry is made, and then the character dies). Once alone, the character is confronted with a man that looks like the description if Captain Halaror, "You've been asking after me. Why?" The captain has Psychology 65%, and can roll it to detect a lie. If the character lies he gets cuffed until he answers truthfully. The Captain will agree to take the characters, but a PSYCHOLOGY roll will show that he is hiding something.



Section IV
The boat leaves the next day, and the characters are on board. It will take the day to reach the isle. If the characters have seen the original crew, then an IDEA roll will show that none of the original crew are there, in their place are men all with dark skins, about six. Once land is out of site, the characters are confronted by the captain who demands that they hand over the mannequin, and the sailors jump down to surround the characters. If the characters let them have it, they will be made to walk the plank, to much humour from the captain, if they do not the characters will be attacked by all but the captain. At the end of the fight, he will plead with them not to kill him, he was made to do it by the Moon Beasts. The journey will now be more difficult, unless the characters can sail. If they kill the captain then it will be nigh on impossible if they cannot sail, but fate may guide them if they are sufficiently Lucky.



Section V
Arriving at the isle, the characters can climb around to the opposite side in one full day. There they see the faces of the human gods. IDEA roll will cause the characters to recollect that the people that the saw in Janitculn, the westerners, look almost the same as the gods. The captain will tell them that there is only one town in the far west, Soros, and that to enter it you have to obtain permission from the city guard, something not granted very often. As they leave, in the distance there are nightgaunts flying, but too far away to make out any details, they just look like giant bats. If the captain is asked, he will shiver and say that he does not want to know.



Section VI
Arriving back in Norith, it will be easy to hire a carriage, or become mercenaries on a trading caravan to Janticuln. The trip to Janticuln is uneventful, and on arriving they can ask around for caravans going to Soros, of which there are none, and then after westerners. There are some who seem willing. If the mannequin is used to detect evil, these will reek of it, for they are really Moon Beasts who have changed their appearance. The westerners, Hungin, Jantin and Loro will tell the characters that the human Gods currently reside in Soros, but only for a short period and they need to hurry there. They can go with them as they return to Soros, or can travel by themselves. Hungin will point out the difficultly of travelling alone with bandits about, and that they even know a secret passage into the citadel, thus avoiding any problems with the city guard.



Section VII
The journey is uneventful, and they arrive outside the huge basalt walls of Soros. Jantin goes into the city via the main gate with the carts, which are searched thoroughly, and then Hungin and Loro guide the characters to a small stone outcropping, which once moved reveals a trap door. This leads into a rock passage hewn out of the stone. Loro explains that this is bolt hole when they have troubles with the city guard. It is dank and smells. Finally the characters come to a door. On the other side wait six moon beasts, and Jantin ready to take the mannequin. As they enter Hungin and Loro change, and the characters are attacked for the mannequin. There is another door through which they can flee. In the city, the dominating structure is the citadel, a huge palace all towers and spires made of basalt and onyx. There are few people in the streets, and the characters can take the artefact to the citadel. There are two guards at the gate. "Halt, what do you want?" If the characters say that they have come to see the Human Gods, they will be let through, otherwise they will be refused entry. They are guided to a huge throne room, where there are three huge men, and three huge women, in the likeness of the carving s on the mountain who are dancing madly. There is also a chair on which sits a beautiful woman, with cats all around her, stroking one on her lap, her head is that of a cat. If the characters have the elm, she purrs at them "Leave it here and I will see to it that it is dealt with." She will not respond to other queries, and if annoyed will set the cats on the characters. As they leave, they see her place the elm branch and the mannequin in a huge chest which lies under her throne.

The characters can now regain 3D8 sanity.

4th April, 1890

Dear Sir,I regret to inform you that your uncle, Clesvial Arnia, has passed away. Your uncle died in a tragic accident, falling to his death from the top of a bluff in the region. You are his last surviving relative, and to you falls his estate. I am the executor of your uncles not inconsiderable estate, and you are named as the soul successor in the will.
Unfortunately, there are also some specifications that you must meet before taking hold of your uncles property. Firstly he specifies that you must journey to Romania, with the tickets enclosed, along with some of your most trusted and closest friends. He then asks that when you arrive you spend at least one night staying in his manor, that lies outside the town. This being done, you will receive in full the value of his estate.
Also find enclosed a key which was to be sent to you the moment of his death. I do not no what it is for.
When you arrive, seek me out at our law firms and I will provide you with the keys to the house.


Yours Sincerely

Letter From Clesvial
Dear Nephew,

This must seem rather of a shock to you, discovering that you have a long lost uncle living in Romania. Well, the estate will soon be yours, and you may take it and leave if you wish, after fulfilling the requirements of the will. If these are not fulfilled, I have made provisions for my estate to go to charity.
I would now ask you that you read carefully what I am about to write here, take it seriously or do not, but be warned, if you do not, a devilish hell will come to the world, and wreak havoc across the lands.
In the summer of 1866, I came to live in this manor. I originally lived in Munich, but got tired of the city life, and having just made a moderate profit, I purchased this house at a low price and settled down to retire.
At the time, there was much talk in the village of the fact that the old owner had died mysteriously, and there was a lot of talk of the supernatural, vampires and other unwholesome things. At first I ignored it, but one day I was refurnishing the previous owners study, when I came upon some form of secret passage way. I had the passage opened up, and the room now forms my study, for which you have the key.
In this secret room I found many old and ancient works, some speaking of things so blasphemous that I burnt them for the evil words. I have been a Catholic all my life, and such blasphemy should not be allowed on Earth.
My mind, however, was changed when I discovered among the magical paraphernalia a very odd doll, or dress makers mannequin. It appeared as a normal mannequin, yet it had singularly disturbing features to its face and torso. The arms and legs also appear slightly dysfunctional, and when the whole creation was assembled, it gave out a radiance of such evil that I decided to dispose of it. But, not fire, nor acids, nor steel would even impinge upon its scabrous surface.
I now regretted destroying so many of the tomes, but from what was left, I gathered that the artefact, for that is what it is, is many eons aged, and can by used for vile magical purposes. I also discovered that it's true name could not be spoken by a mortal in its presence without awakening creatures so blasphemous from the depths of hell, that I destroyed immediately all reference to the name of the thing.
I now set out to destroy the thing, for its power and evil could by used in many ways, not the least of controlling other people! Imagine the chaos it could cause! The following passage came from a book buried deep in the Royal Library in London:

'...and this thing, evil and eternal, a shape of a man, but that which could be used to destroy man, and call forth beings of unutterable foulness, can not be destroyed by man but only by those who are above man but weaker than man... ...and only with the aid of...'

The book was rent and torn as if some madman had tried to destroy it, but from further researches I discovered that the dream gods of men can destroy that which would destroy man.
My researches however had not gone unnoticed by others that sought the power that the mannequin could give. And while returning to Romania, I was accosted four times by different people attempting to gain the artefact. I have hence pawned the artefact, secretly, and only kept the head.
Please, if you can, destroy this foulness from the Earth.


Yours Sincerely



Clesvial Arnia

Article In The Anzio Newspaper
Runways, or Kidnaps

Two local girls, Evanda Itana and Juliana Liro, who vanished last week have still not been found. Local police can find no evidence of kidnapping, except for the fact that the girls rooms were both in a shambles. This is consistent with not only a kidnapping but also a flight from Anzio. Local police speculated yesterday that one, or both of the girls had got themselves pregnant and fled together to get away from the disaster that they had created fro themselves. Evanda and Juliana did not know each other very well, Evanda's mother said, which is a point that does not support them fleeing together. At this stage, the police will continue investigations for another week, and if no new evidence appears by that time, they will give up the search.

Man Found Dead

A man was found floating in the Seine late last night by a gendarme walking the rounds by the river. The man was not a Frenchman, but gendarme's have been able to track down where he was staying, in a local hotel. His room was ransacked, and it is believed that he was killed there in a bungled burglary, although there was still money in the room. The gendarme have not released any information on the cause of death, but they have said that there was some paint or other substance over the mans forehead.

Young Boy Vanishes

The third young boy has vanished from the Endburg Wood, behind our village. Maureen Devonport's son, Maiz, and the son of Howard Willmore, Marcus, vanished in the wood two weeks ago. Yesterday, Michael Johanu was reported missing by his mother. The police do not know what is happening, but speculate that their may be some wild animal that is taking the children, or that they are becoming lost. This is however unlikely, as the sweep through the woods after the first disappearance discovered nothing. All the boys who have vanished told their parents that they were playing near Tom's Rock, but it is uncertain if they even reached their destination.
